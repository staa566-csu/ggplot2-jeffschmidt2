## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.





```{r}

library("ggplot2")
setwd("C:/Users/jschm/OneDrive/Desktop/Subterm 1/STAA 566 - Data Visualization")
comp<-read.csv("Continents_Transposed_2.csv")

head(comp)

comp_plot<-ggplot(data = comp, mapping = aes(x = Year,
                          y = Rate, color = Region))
comp_plot + geom_line()





```
